    <p>
        I specialize in web development, with a 
        focus on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
        My expertise includes creating and designing websites,
        combining these technologies to craft visually appealing 
        and responsive user interfaces. I consistently update my
        skills to stay current with evolving web trends.
        I'm passionate about collaborating with teams to
        deliver high-quality web solutions that prioritize
        efficiency and user-centric design, 
        ensuring a memorable online experience for users.
